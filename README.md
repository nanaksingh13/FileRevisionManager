Certainly! Here's a simple README file template that you can use for your GitHub repository to describe your Python file revision management script:

# File Revision Management System

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8%2B-blue)
![Watchdog Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/watchdog-2.1%2B-green)

A Python script for monitoring and managing file revisions based on file modifications. This script uses the Watchdog library to track changes in specified files and directories, creating new revisions with timestamps when changes occur.

## Features

- Continuous monitoring of specified files and directories.
- Automatic creation of new file revisions upon modification.
- Configuration management through a CSV file.
- Duplicate file prevention based on MD5 checksum.
- Flexible and customizable for different file revision needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Watchdog library (version 2.1 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install watchdog
   ```

### Usage

1. Configure the file revision settings by editing the `file_config.csv` file.
2. Run the script:

   ```shell
   python file_revision.py
   ```

3. The script will continuously monitor the specified files and directories for changes and create revisions as needed.

### Configuration

You can customize the file revision configuration by editing the `file_config.csv` file. The CSV file contains two columns: `file_path` and `revision_dir`. Specify the file paths to monitor and the corresponding revision directories.

```csv
file_path,revision_dir
/path/to/file1.txt,/path/to/revisions1
/path/to/file2.txt,/path/to/revisions2
```
